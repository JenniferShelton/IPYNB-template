At Authorea, we want to change the way scientists communicate and share their research. This includes giving all the information behind figures a place to live: by letting readers and reviewers access your data and code, your results can be easily reproduced and extended.

It's really easy to incorporate IPython Notebooks in your articles.  First, upload a figure to your article. You can do so by dragging and dropping an image or by clicking \textbf{Insert Figure} at the bottom of the block you want it under.  

When your figure is in place you can \textbf{attach data} to it. We take json, csv, dat files and \textbf{IPython Notebooks}.
